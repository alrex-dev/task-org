# Task Organizer
Task Organizer is a personal project used to manage the information such as time spent, credentials and actions taken for all the projects that I have handled. It is using Vue 3 in Vite, Pinia and Axios for the frontend.

## Backend
The backend files are in a separate repository: [Task Org API](https://github.com/alrex-dev/task-org-api)  
Backend is using PHP and MySL.    

The URL for the Task Org API is declared in the stores/globals.js
